Consensus refers to a function of modular blockchains where the ordering of transactions is agreed upon by a set of [validators](https://celestia.org/glossary/validator/). To agree on the order of transactions in a block, validators follow a [consensus algorithm](https://celestia.org/glossary/consensus-algorithm/).
