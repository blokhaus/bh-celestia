A data availability layer refers to a blockchain that provides [data availability](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability/) for other types of chains, like [rollups](https://celestia.org/glossary/rollup/). In the modular ecosystem, data availability layers make use of technologies like [data availability sampling](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability-sampling/) to provide scalable and trust-minimized data availability.
