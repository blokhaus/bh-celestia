A rollup is a type of blockchain that offloads some work to a layer 1, like Celestia. Rollups host applications and process user transactions. Once those transactions get processed, they are then published to layer 1. Itâ€™s layer 1s job to order those transactions and check that they are available, at minimum.

Over time, two primary designs emerged for rollups: [optimistic](https://celestia.org/glossary/optimistic-rollup/) and [zk rollups](https://celestia.org/glossary/zk-rollup).
