A data availability committee (DAC) is a permissioned group of nodes responsible for providing data availability to a blockchain. DAC’s are an insecure source of data availability because they make an honest majority assumption and don’t have any stake to slash if a data withholding attack is attempted. Data availability committees are primarily used to provide a cheap and less secure source of data availability to L2s.
