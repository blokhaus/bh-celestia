A bridge between two blockchains that doesn’t require an intermediary, a committee, or an honest majority assumption to ensure that funds can’t be stolen. An example of a trust-minimized bridge is one between Ethereum and a rollup built on top of it.

A trust-minimized bridge is more secure than a trusted bridge. For that reason, chains that share trust-minimized bridges with each other can be thought of as a “cluster” or chains.
