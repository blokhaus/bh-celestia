A full node that is responsible for producing blocks. In most blockchains, miners or validators are responsible for producing and proposing blocks when they are the leader. For rollups, block producers, also known as sequencers or operators, only build blocks with transactions, which they publish to a separate blockchain for consensus and data availability.
