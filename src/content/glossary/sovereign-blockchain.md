A blockchain that has independent control over itself and its applications via social consensus. A sovereign chain has the ability to respond to hacks and push upgrades.

In the context of a modular stack, a modular blockchain can only be considered sovereign if it has the ability to fork through social consensus without the permission of any underlying layers it utilizes. Rollups that utilize a modular stack to retain sovereignty are known as sovereign rollups.
