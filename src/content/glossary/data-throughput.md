A measurement of the data capacity of a blockchain. Data throughput is calculated by the amount of data that a blockchain can process, measured in kb/s or mb/s. For example, consider a blockchain that has a block size of 10MB and a block time of 20 seconds. The data throughput of the blockchain would be 0.5MB/s. Data throughput is most relevant to data availability layers because their primary job is to provide a high capacity for data.
