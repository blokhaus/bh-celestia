Modular blockchains are specialists that only perform one or two functions. The functions that modular blockchains can specialize in are:

1. [Execution](https://celestia.org/glossary/execution/)
2. [Settlement](https://celestia.org/glossary/settlement/)
3. [Consensus](https://celestia.org/glossary/consensus/)
4. [Data availability](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability/)

Modular chains donâ€™t sit alone, though. Multiple of them combine to perform all the tasks a monolithic chain does by itself. This combination of chains is what we call a [modular stack](https://celestia.org/glossary/modular-stack/).

For example, Celestia is a modular blockchain that specializes in providing consensus and data availability for other types of chains.
