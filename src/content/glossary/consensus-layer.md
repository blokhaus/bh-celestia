A consensus layer refers to a modular blockchain that provides transaction ordering for other modular blockchains, like [rollups](https://celestia.org/glossary/rollup/). Modular blockchains that are a consensus layer may also provide data availability, like Celestia. ‘Consensus layer’ may also refer to the [consensus mechanism](https://celestia.org/glossary/consensus-algorithm/) of a monolithic blockchain.
