A bridge between two blockchains that requires either a trusted intermediary, committee or an honest majority assumption to ensure that funds can’t be stolen. A trusted bridge can be exploited more easily than a trust-minimized bridge because it provides weaker guarantees for its security.

Examples of trusted bridges are the bridge for WBTC which is run by BitGo, a committee based bridge like Axelar, or the IBC bridge between Osmosis and the Cosmos Hub.
