Settlement primarily refers to a function of modular blockchains where transaction proofs from rollups are verified and [disputes](https://celestia.org/glossary/dispute-resolution/) are resolved. Modular blockchains that specialize in settlement (e.g. [settlement layers](https://celestia.org/glossary/settlement-layer/)) may also provide other features, such as a liquidity source or bridging hub.
