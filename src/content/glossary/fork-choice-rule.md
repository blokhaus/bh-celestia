An algorithm that nodes use to correctly identify and follow the canonical chain. In Nakamoto consensus, the consensus mechanism that Bitcoin uses, nodes follow the chain that has the most total difficulty - the most work put towards mining it. In Tendermint, the consensus mechanism used by Cosmos chains, nodes follow the chain that has valid blocks signed by â…” of the stake.
