Communication that occurs between blockchains that are in different clusters. Since inter-cluster communication involves bridges that rely on an honest majority assumption to ensure that funds can’t be stolen, communication can’t be trust-minimized. The Ethereum-Polygon bridge is an example of inter-cluster communication because 2/3 of a committee is required to sign off on blocks.
