A type of rollup that does not use a settlement layer to determine its canonical chain and validity rules. Instead, the canonical chain of the rollup is determined by the nodes in the rollup's peer-to-peer network. This means that settlement occurs on the rollup, rather than a separate settlement layer.

Sovereign rollups have three key benefits:

1. More freedom over the execution environment
2. No sharing of computation resources
3. Ability to hard fork if something goes wrong
