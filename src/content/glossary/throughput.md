A measurement of the capacity of a blockchain. Throughput primarily measures two elements: data throughput and transaction throughput. Data throughput determines a blockchainâ€™s data capacity, which is measured in kb/s or mb/s. Data throughput is most relevant to data availability layers because their primary job is to provide a high capacity for data.

Transaction throughput measures the computational capacity of a blockchain, which is commonly calculated by the number of transactions that can be processed per second (TPS). However, TPS is a subjective measure of throughput as transactions can vary in size. An objective measurement of throughput is the number of computational units that can be performed per second.
