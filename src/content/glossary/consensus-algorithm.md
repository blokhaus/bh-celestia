A consensus algorithm is a set of rules that blockchains use to determine how nodes produce new blocks and agree to finalize them. Examples of blockchain consensus algorithms include Tendermint, commonly used by Cosmos chains, Casper, used by Ethereum and Nakamoto consensus used by Bitcoin. Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are commonly confused as consensus algorithms, when they are actually sybil resistance mechanisms.
