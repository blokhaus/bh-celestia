A type of market that blockchains implement to prevent malicious actors from spamming the network. Fee markets typically utilize an auction mechanism, where users can specify their transaction fee and bid to have their transaction included in the next block. Fee markets are most noticeable for blockchains that experience high fees where demand exceeds capacity, and users are forced to increasingly bid up their transaction fees to be included in a block.
