An execution layer is a type of modular blockchain whose primary job is hosting smart contracts and executing transactions. A common example of an execution layer is a [rollup](https://celestia.org/glossary/rollup/). Execution layers utilize one or multiple other modular blockchains to fulfill any of the following functions: [settlement](https://celestia.org/glossary/settlement/), [consensus](https://celestia.org/glossary/consensus/), or [data availability](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability/).

An execution layer may also refer to the execution environment of a monolithic blockchain.
