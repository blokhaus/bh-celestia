The ability for applications on a blockchain to read and write state to each other. Composability allows applications to coordinate with and build on top of one another such that it enables an ecosystem of interconnected applications.

For example, an application that automates liquidity strategies on Uniswap requires it to be reading and writing the state of Uniswapâ€™s contracts.
